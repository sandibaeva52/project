      'Hunt Slonem (b. 1951)' +
      'Best known for his representational imagery with elements of Abstract Expressionism, Hunt Slonem often fuses mysticism and whimsy in his animal subjects. Born in New York, Slonem studied at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture and Tulane University. His interest in birds – a frequent subject of the artist – began as a child living in Hawaii and studying in Nicaragua. These travels have also heavily influenced his work, infusing them with elements of varying cultures. His work has been featured in numerous solo and group exhibitions, and can be found in the public collections of the Guggenheim Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and the Moreau Foundation, including numerous private collections. The artist currently lives and works in New York.'+
